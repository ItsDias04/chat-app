Diffie-Hellman Protocol for chat app

A chat application designed to demonstrate the Diffie-Hellman protocol in action, featuring a user interface built with KivyMD.

Requirements:
  1. You need to install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
  2. First, run the server.py file (edit the server file to change the port if port 8880 is already in use).
  3. Run the main1.py file. This file starts the client application.
  4. Create a chat and add the usernames of participants who will join the conversation.
  5. Log in as other users, specify their username and the chat name, and connect.
  6. You can now start chatting! (There is a button to change the encryption key, which triggers the key exchange algorithm).
